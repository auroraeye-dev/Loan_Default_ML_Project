# Loan Default Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning–based classification system to predict loan default risk using borrower demographic, financial, and credit-related features. The goal is to simulate real-world credit risk modeling used by banks and NBFCs to support informed lending decisions.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Predict whether a borrower is likely to default on a loan  
- Analyze borrower behavior and credit risk patterns  
- Minimize default risk while supporting responsible loan approvals  

---

## 🧠 Methodology
The project follows an end-to-end ML pipeline:
1. Data loading and cleaning  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature engineering and encoding  
4. Model training using Logistic Regression  
5. Model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix  

---

## 📊 Model Performance
- **Training Accuracy:** 87%  
- **Test Accuracy:** 80%  
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Confusion Matrix, Classification Accuracy  

The confusion matrix helps analyze false positives and false negatives, which is critical for financial risk assessment.
